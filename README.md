The [PCORnet Antibiotics and Childhood Growth Study](https://www.pcori.org/research-results/2015/looking-effects-antibiotic-use-childhood-obesity-and-growth-pcornet%C2%AE) is one of the first large observational studies done in [PCORnet](https://www.pcornet.org), a collaboration of health systems across the United States to accelerate large-scale, patient-centered research.  The study brought together researchers from multiple institutions, and was based on data standardized in the [PCORnet data network](https://pcornet.org/data-driven-common-model/).

This repository contains resources developed by members of the study team based in PEDSnet during the conduct of the study.
